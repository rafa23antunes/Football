## "Liga NOS"

This is the first football league of Portugal, my country. <br>
It's a league mainly recognized by the three big ("trÃªs grandes") but with other quality teams. <br>
The first ever league in Portugal occurred in 1934 and was called "Experimental Portuguese League" with only 8 teams. At that time, a win gave the team two points, a draw one point and a defeat 0.
It has been evolved until the league we all see today.

In the folder "Resultados" I put the results of some tasks that I made myself do. <br>
At this moment, it only has the *.csv result of the sum of points of each team for year. For example:<br><br>
Imagine that the 'Team A' has <i>x</i> points in 'Year i' and has <i>y</i> points in 'Year i+1'. The result will be that the 'Team A' has <i>x</i> points in 'Year i' and has <i>x+y </i>points in 'Year i+1' and so on.

You can see the resoult in a race graph in this link:

## Worksheet

Here I used:

<ul>
<li><b>Jupyter Notebook/Python</b></li> - I used tools, such as <b>pandas</b>, <b>numpy</b> etc. to work with the data frames that I previously created and obtain the result that i wanted.
</ul>
