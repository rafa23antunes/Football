## "Liga NOS"

This is the first football league of Portugal, my country. <br>
It's a league mainly recognized by the three big ("trÃªs grandes") but with other quality teams. <br>
The first ever league in Portugal occurred in 1934 and was called "Experimental Portuguese League" with only 8 teams. At that time, a win gave the team two points, a draw one point and a defeat 0.<br>
It has been evolved until the league we all see today.


## Worksheet

Here I used:

<ul>
<li><b>Jupyter Notebook/Python</b></li> - I used tools, such as <b>pandas</b>, <b>numpy</b> etc. to work with the data frames and obtain the result that I wanted.
</ul>
